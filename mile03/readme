   Time Taken = 56.00 seconds

2) Bag of Letters = blzx*nk*et*uc
   Word = UNEXCITABLE
   Score = 2337
   Time Taken = 22.00 seconds

3) Bag of Letters = qw*vbcl**brmv
   Word = MICAWBER
   Score = 1092
   Time Taken = 14.00 seconds

4) Bag of Letters = navdq*ruto*b*qw
   Word = BANQUETED
   Score = 1995
   Time Taken = 10.00 seconds

5) Bag of Letters = co*gvd**tq*b
   Word = COEQUATED
   Score = 1479
